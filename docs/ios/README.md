Finally, if your app has not been previously configured for push notifications, you will need to update your provisioning profile or use an Xcode managed profile. This is also a good time to add the "App Groups" capability to your profile if it doesn't have it already. Here's what to do:

Click Here to go to your provisioning profile list.

If your app does not have a profile, or you are using a wildcard profile: Create a new provisioning profile. Import it into Xcode and use it for future builds of your application.
If your app is built using a profile that is "Managed By Xcode": You will need to refresh your provisioning profile if it does not refresh automatically.
Otherwise: Select your provisioning profile, select "Edit", then click "Generate". Then refresh your profiles in Xcode.
To refresh your provisioning profiles navigate to Xcode > Preferences > Accounts and select your Apple Id. Then click Download Manual Profiles.
